# McBot

BowsiePup is a great coder, and works commonly on Discord Bots. I asked him to teach me how to code a discord bot, specifically to make this. With much of his guidance, this was the end product. I absolutely loved it while it was up, and I owe him a lot for doing this.

Sadly, no one in my McDonald's used Discord, so this wasn't deployed for long.
